<p align="center">My personal website, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and deployed to Vercel.<p/>

## Overview

As a developer, I believe it is essential to have a centralized platform to display my projects and skills. This portfolio website serves as that platform, allowing potential clients, collaborators, or employers to get a better understanding of my skills and capabilities.

The website is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js:](https://nextjs.org/) Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and other powerful features.
- [Tailwind CSS:](https://tailwindcss.com/) Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework used for styling the website in a highly customizable manner.
- [React:](https://react.dev/) React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it serves as the foundation for the website's components.

## Installation

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:
